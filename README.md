Magic-Chess
===========


OVERVIEW
--------------------

Magic chess is a multi-player online turn-based game which is played on a chessboard consisting of 32 squares: four rows and eight columns. In the game, one player plays with the red pieces, and the other player plays with the black pieces.
At the start of the game the 32 chess pieces are ‘flipped over’ and randomly placed on the board. Don’t think of them as traditional chess pieces, but as chips with two sides. To win the game, players need to turn over the pieces and capture all of the opponent’s chessmen.
